Red-Green-Go
=============

Red-Green-Go! is a board-game-inspired coaching activity, designed to introduce the agile practices of test-driven development and ping-pong pairing. The aim is to allow learners to experience the flow of the TDD style of development on a small but real example, in a short amount of time, without needing lots of guidance and hand-holding.

It was designed by Martin Borizanov, Suzanne Embury and Caroline Jay, in the School of Computer Science, at the University of Manchester.

This repository contains resources for use when playing Red-Green-Go!  The [wiki](https://github.com/redgreengo/Red-Green-Go/wiki) contains explanations of some of the concepts (including further information for users of the various "guidance cards" provided as part of the game.

Red-Green-Go! can be played with your own programming task.  Or, you can use one of the graded scenarios we have prepared:

* Roman Numeral Converter: this simple scenario shows how we can drive the implementation of a single method on a single class, using TDD.
* Soldiers on Parade: this example shows how we use TDD to drive out the need for private methods, while implementing a public method on a single class.
